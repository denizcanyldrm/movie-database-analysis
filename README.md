- python version 3

#Project Motivation:

In this project, I study the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset in various aspects. While doing the project, I try to learn the basics of the data science process by making some analysis on the data and developing machine learning algorithms.

#File Descriptions
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle (found in https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). It is a public dataset which consists of 4803 rows and 20 columns. Respective columns are:

- Budget, Genres, Homepage, Id, Keywords, Original Language,  Original Title, Overview, Popularity, Production Companies, Production Countries, Release Date,       Revenue, Runtime,Spoken Languages, Status, Tagline, Title, Vote Average, Vote Count

#Results and Findings:

- How is the distribution of movies according to genres?
- What are the leading production companies?
- How are the average votes distributed among movies?
- Predicting Popularity of Movies using Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression
